This is an NFT evolution. 

## Semi-Mutable NFTs

Every NFT has it's immutable core (art, music, text), but the limitations of current NFTs are that the core is all there is. Many things can and should change over time. Some examples include: 
- A book ends up with notes in the margins, different reviews, different covers, a different preface, all based on a single text
- A science paper may accumulate citations (inbound or outbound), replications, reviews, refutations, new data, prizes
- A piece of music can be remixed, edited for explicit content, have a music video, collect reviews, awards and other things
- A journalistic work could add follow ups, change due to further research, collect awards, have opinions written about it
- Code changes versions, acquires new comments, new documentation

In short, unique art is far from the only possible use of an NFT, and I want to be able to add value to an original, because sometimes, when a thing changes over time the value of that thing grows much more than if it was just a static thing. 

I think we can enable this sort of community enrichment without changing the core value created, and we can do it in a way that is decentralized through and through. 

Building on one or more L2 solutions, and always maintaining a connection to Ethereum, I want to build this out. It will require a decentralized server architecture to provide the right metadata for the NFTs. 

The ultimate goal is a network of NFTs, where the value of one can build the value of another. Community engagement in the value creation is easy and permissionless, but the content owner and/or creator retains control of the core creation within the NFT. 

## Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
